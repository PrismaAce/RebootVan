(!) This mod doesn't work with any content mods.

This adds a Reboot Van which will generate in your world, allowing you to bring back fallen allies from the dead.

To refuel the van, you must defeat bosses for the first time.

Note: When a player is dead, their character is temporarily set to Mediumcore until they're revived, this is intended behaviour.

Hopefully everything works smoothly with the mod for the most part. The only issue is that reviving a ghost who is far away from the van will cause them to fall into the unloaded void and die again. So only revive someone who's near the van.
